## Finding Ideas

Ideas for articles don't always come easy. When having trouble, try these approaches:

- Previous articles. Have I learned something new? If I cite a Wikipedia article, can I write something better and cite that instead?
- Zotero collection. You added the papers there because they interested you at one time. Try organizing it, for example. This forces you to take another look.
- Popular HN threads. You might want to get some ideas for sort of off-topic posts. Summarize a popular thread. You know there will be an audience.
