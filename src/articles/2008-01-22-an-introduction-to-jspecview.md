Like [chemical structures](http://depth-first.com/articles/2007/11/27/chemwriter-chemical-structures-and-the-web), X-Y graphical data such as NMRs, chromatograms, mass spectra, and IRs are a ubiquitous and essential part of the language of chemistry. Although many software tools have been developed for sharing and manipulating X-Y data, few of them are suited for use on the Web. This article, the first in a series, introduces one X-Y data tool that can be used with the Web, [JSpecView](http://jspecview.sourceforge.net/).

Jean-Claude Bradley's introductory video gives a feel for what JSpecView is capable of. Another overview is available in the [Chemistry Central JSpecView article](http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1752-153X-1-31) written by JSpecView's project lead, Robert Lancashire. Here are some of the highlights:

-  Displays full range of [JCAMP-DX](http://www.iupac.org/standing/cpep/wp_jcamp_dx.html) formats and protocols.
-  Zoom in and out.
-  NMR integration.
-  Absorbance/Transmission toggle for IR spectra.
-  Multiple plot overlap.
-  Browser-scriptable with JavaScript.
-  JDK 1.5 and above.

A number of [JSpecView demonstrations](http://jspecview.sourceforge.net/) are available. Some of the most illustrative include:

-  [N-ethylaniline 1H NMR and IR](http://wwwchem.uwimona.edu.jm/spectra/JSpecView/sample/sample1.html)
-  [4-chloroaniline interactive IR and vibrational modes](http://wwwchem.uwimona.edu.jm/spectra/JSpecView/iranim/pclanilineJ/pclaniline.html)
-  [GC headspace from coffee](http://wwwchem.uwimona.edu.jm/spectra/JSpecView/gcms/coffee/index.html)
-  [1H NMR spectral assignment of aspirin](http://wwwchem.uwimona.edu.jm/spectra/JSpecView/nmranim/aspirinJ/aspirin.html)
-  [1H NMR, 13C NMR, and IR spectral assignment of aspirin](http://wwwchem.uwimona.edu.jm/spectra/JSpecView/combo/acetophenoneJ/acetophenone.html)
-  [Interactive peak table generation](http://wwwchem.uwimona.edu.jm/spectra/JSpecView/combo/PeakTable/PeakTable.html)

JSpecView is Open Source software licensed under the [LGPL](http://opensource.org/licenses/lgpl-license.php). The [SourceForge Project Page](http://sourceforge.net/projects/jspecview/) hosts the source code, documentation, and subversion repository.

Future articles will discuss JSpecView from the developer perspective, including ways to build, deploy, extend, and adapt it.
