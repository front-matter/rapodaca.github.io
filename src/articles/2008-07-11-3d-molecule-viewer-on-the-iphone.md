Portable computing platforms like the iPhone may hold a great deal of untapped potential in science. The last five years have witnessed a sharp increase in their graphics and computational capabilities, with the iPhone setting off a new drive for ever more feature-rich and usable devices. In many lab settings, laptop computers are simply too cumbersome to be practical. A handheld device makes much more sense in these situations.

So, what can the iPhone do for chemistry?

One answer comes from [Brad Larson](http://www.sunsetlakesoftware.com/about), software developer and founder of [Sunset Lake Software](http://www.sunsetlakesoftware.com/). His software, [Molecules](http://www.sunsetlakesoftware.com/molecules), can display a variety of 3D molecular representations on the iPhone. As you might expect for software running on the iPhone, the view can be manipulated with touch screen gestures like two-finger pinch to zoom. Data can be pulled directly from the [PDB](http://www.rcsb.org/pdb).

The author plans to release the Molecules source code under the [BSD License](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php), pending approval from Apple.
