A [2D chemical structure editor](/articles/2007/11/27/chemwriter-chemical-structures-and-the-web) is a key component in most cheminformatics systems. With an ever-increasing number of groups using the Web as a cheminformatics platform, the need for a structure editor built specifically around the capabilities and constraints of the Web becomes more apparent.

For the last several months, my company ([Metamolecular, LLC](http://metamolecular.com)) has been developing a 2D structure editor called [ChemWriter(TM)](http://metamolecular.com/products/chemwriter). It was created specifically to solve the problem of building interactive, chemically-enabled Web applications that look good and load fast.

You can now [download](http://metamolecular.com/downloads/) a free, fully-functional, non-expiring copy of ChemWriter (the ChemWriter Starter Package) good for development and testing of your chemically-aware Web application. The Metamolecular Company Blog has [the details](http://metamolecular.com/blog/2008/01/14/chemwriter-starter-package-now-available-for-download/).
