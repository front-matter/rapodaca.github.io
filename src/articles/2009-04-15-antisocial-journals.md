[Bosco](http://boscoh.com/) recently posted [some interesting thoughts](http://boscoh.com/science/why-i-think-the-plos-commenting-system-kinda-sucks) on the comments and ratings system for the [Public Library of Science](http://www.plos.org/) (PLoS):

>I like PLOS. I really do. Look I've published two articles with them. I fully believe that they represent a big stepping stone to the future of science publishing.

>Yet, oh yet, I feel like their attempt at building community is kinda shoddy at the moment. The heart of any social media website (reddit, slashdot, 4chan etc.) is the commenting and rating system. The commenting and rating system of the PLOS website is really poor, and I canâ€™t see how it will gain traction given the usability failings.

Sound familiar?

I wrote the following as a comment:

There have been a few attempts to create centralized rating/discussion services for the scientific literature. For but one example, consider "The Scientific Debate", a now defunct service that was [originally reviewed here](/articles/2007/01/16/the-scientific-debate-digg-meets-science).

Given the right approach, it seems at least plausible that a centralized discussion/rating system for a segment of the scientific literature could work. The attempts to date have been less than inspiring, but this shouldn't be surprising at all given the novelty of the medium.

With time, the right plan, and the right team behind it, my money's on young upstarts to do what scientific journals can't or won't do for themselves.
