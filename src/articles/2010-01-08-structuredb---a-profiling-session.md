I came across this intriguing presentation, apparently by [Jonathan Alvarsson](http://friendfeed.com/jonalv), while doing some research on [Mychem](http://mychem.sourceforge.net/). Although the context is not described in detail, the fundamental problems should be familiar to anyone who has built a chemical database.

For those who may not know, Mychem is is an open source cheminformatics extension for MySQL based on [Open Babel](http://openbabel.org/). From the about page:

>... This extension provides a set of functions that permits to handle chemical data within the MySQL database. These functions permit you to search, analyze and convert chemical data. ...

Mychem is one of a few approaches to providing free chemistry database "cartridge" functionality that are now available. Others include [OrChem](http://orchem.sourceforge.net/) and [Pgchem](http://pgfoundry.org/projects/pgchem/). Each of these projects extends the underlying database to enable seamless integration of cheminformtics functions alongside those provided natively.

It turns out that this find coincided with a recent question posted to [BlueObelisk Exchange](http://blueobelisk.stackexchange.com/) asking about the [best free tools for structure database search](http://blueobelisk.stackexchange.com/questions/154/what-are-the-best-free-tools-for-structure-database-search).

If you've built a chemical database, what technologies did you use for integrating chemical structure data with non-structure data and why?
