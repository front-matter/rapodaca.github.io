Developing a network of contacts is often cited as career advice to chemists. Sometimes, LinkedIn is [suggested](https://cen.acs.org/articles/90/i45/SUPPORT.html) as a good service for doing so.

A recent post describing why one user [quit LinkedIn](http://blog.capwatkins.com/quitting-linkedin) altogether got me thinking about how useful this service is in practice. An older D-F post talked about some [problems with LinkedIn forums](http://depth-first.com/articles/2010/06/29/linkedin-forums-how-do-i-despise-thee-let-me-count-the-ways/) - specifically, the limitations of investing time and effort on closed discussion forums with a limited audience.

Given the currently [underperforming chemistry job market](http://depth-first.com/articles/2012/12/19/the-manic-depressive-chemistry-jobs-market-a-24-year-perspective/), and the often-cited connection between LinkedIn and finding a job, it seems reasonable to ask chemists - what has LinkedIn done for you lately?

What better way to [ask](https://twitter.com/rapodaca/status/288372461580455936) than with that other social media site, Twitter. Responses have so far been mixed. Here's a sample:

If you've successfully used LinkedIn to land a chemistry position or solve a technical problem you faced in your job, how did you do it? If another service or approach gave better results, which one did you use and how?
