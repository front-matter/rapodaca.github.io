The [IUPAC International Chemical Indentifier](http://www.iupac.org/inchi/) (InChI) provides an open system for converting molecular representations into strings of text. Because text processing is one of the things computers do very well, InChI serves as an important link between chemistry and computer science.

Unfortunately, the InChI documentation is rather scattered. To help remedy this problem, I have selected some links to Depth-First articles discussing InChI. These articles span a wide range of perspectives. They have been divided into categories for easier navigation, although many contain information that any user of InChI could find useful.

# InChI in Context

-  [Interconvert Almost Any SMILES and InChI with Ruby Open Babel](/articles/2007/06/25/interconvert-almost-any-smiles-and-inchi-with-ruby-open-babel) The risk-free way to test InChI.
-  [Eleven Qualities of the Perfect Line Notation for the Web](/articles/2007/03/14/eleven-qualities-of-the-perfect-line-notation-for-the-web) Whatever limitations it may have, designing InChI was no easy task.
-  [How to Find Chemical Information on the Internet: Why Open Source, Open Access and Open Data Matter](/articles/2007/01/26/how-to-find-chemical-information-on-the-internet-why-open-source-open-access-and-open-data-matter) InChI is also part of the process.
-  [Thirty-Two Free Chemistry Databases](/articles/2007/01/24/thirty-two-free-chemistry-databases) Many of them use InChI already.
-  [The Automatic Encoding of Chemical Structures](/articles/2006/09/05/the-automatic-encoding-of-chemical-structures) Why InChI needs to be heard but not seen.
-  [Debabelization](/articles/2006/11/08/debabelization) Why InChI probably isn't the last line notation you'll ever need.
-  [107 Years of Line Formula Notations 1861-1968](/articles/2006/08/18/107-years-of-line-formula-notations-1861-1968) InChI is the latest in a long ...ummm... line of indexing systems.
-  [Everything Old is New Again: Wiswesser Line Notation (WLN)](/articles/2007/07/20/everything-old-is-new-again-wiswesser-line-notation-wln) The early roots of InChI.

# Hacking InChI

-  [Hacking ChemSpider: Query by SMILES and InChI with Ruby](/articles/2007/09/17/hacking-chemspider-query-by-smiles-and-inchi-with-ruby) The easy way to mash-up ChemSpider.

-  [Decoding InChIs with Rino](/articles/2006/09/19/decoding-inchis-with-rino) Instructive, but no longer recommended.
-  [Taking a SWIG of InChI](/articles/2006/09/16/taking-a-swig-of-inchi) It may leave a doozy of a hangover, but it'll cure what ails ya.
-  [InChI Canonization Algorithm](/articles/2006/08/12/inchi-canonicalization-algorithm) More detail than you probably wanted to know.

# InChI and the Web

-  [My InChI Runneth Over](/articles/2007/05/17/my-inchi-runneth-over) Why InChI makes grown Web designers cry.
