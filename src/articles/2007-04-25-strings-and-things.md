I ran across John Bradshaw's excellent presentation [Strings and Things](http://daylight.com/meetings/mug01/Bradshaw/History/800x600/Strings_and_Things/sld001.htm). Part historical overview, part explanation of the SMILES/SMARTS [line notation](http://depth-first.com/articles/2007/03/14/eleven-qualities-of-the-perfect-line-notation-for-the-web) systems, Bradshaw's slides are chock full of interesting tidbits.

My favorite: [slide 29](http://daylight.com/meetings/mug01/Bradshaw/History/800x600/Strings_and_Things/sld029.htm) - "Line notations are dead." It's a wonderful illustration of why predicting the future of technology is so tricky. The light pen became the mouse, the computer display became color, and Digital fell off a cliff. SMILES and SMARTS are the only things to have survived.
