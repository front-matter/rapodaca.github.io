Web 2.0 may be [all about participation](http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/oreilly/tim/news/2005/09/30/what-is-web-20.html), but the [numbers](http://www.mckinseyquarterly.com/article_page.aspx?ar=2041&l2=17&l3=104&srid=17) reported by [The McKinsey Quarterly](http://www.mckinseyquarterly.com) suggest a self-selecting oligarchy rather than a democracy. Success may well depend more on engaging the top 2-10% of users rather than appealing to all of them. Food for though when forming your next community, be it electronic or otherwise.
