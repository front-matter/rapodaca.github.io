A <a href="http://depth-first.com/articles/2006/08/23/scripting-octet-with-jruby">previous article</a> discussed the use of the Java chemical informatics library Octet from JRuby. This article will discuss the use of another Java chemical infomatics library, <a href="http://cdk.sf.net">CDK</a>, from JRuby. A small Ruby class will be developed that generates a molfile with completely assigned 2-D coordinates from a SMILES string.
