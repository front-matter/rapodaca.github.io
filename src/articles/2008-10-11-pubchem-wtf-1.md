[![WTF](/images/posts/20081010/21022536.png "WTF")](http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/summary/summary.cgi?cid=21022536)

In preparation for the first beta release of [ChemPhoto](http://metamolecular.com/chemphoto), the [chemical structure imaging application](/articles/2008/09/08/smarter-cheminformatics-from-sd-file-to-image-collection-with-chemphoto), I've been performing a lot of tests with [PubChem SD files](/articles/2006/09/29/hacking-pubchem-direct-access-with-ftp). It turns out that having a tool that can be used to quickly browse through tens of thousands of PubChem molecules turns up some very strange beasts, including [the one depicted above](http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/summary/summary.cgi?cid=21022536).

If you're still curious as to what this PubChem record is actually referring to, [this tool](http://www.daylight.com/daycgi/depict?433143324333433443354343364335374334384333394332324331433143323243393343383443373543364336433535433434433333433232433143314332324333334334344335354336433643353543343443333343323243314331433232433333433434433535433643364335354334344333334332324331433143323243333343343443353543364336433535433434433333433232433143314332324333334334344335354336433643353543343443333343323243314343324333433443354336) is quite useful.
