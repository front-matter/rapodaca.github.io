As part of research I'm doing on a new collaborative chemistry Web application, I've been using quite a few social networking and news sites. In the process, I've come across a lot of weird, funny, or just plain cool things online - most of which have little or nothing to do with chemistry or chemical informatics. Given that [readers take the weekend off](http://depth-first.com/articles/2007/08/09/ten-things-that-surprised-me-about-blogging), I thought it might be fun to share the things I'm finding here every Saturday. Enjoy!
