[Collaborative Drug Discovery](http://www.collaborativedrug.com) (CDD) is a Web-based platform for drug discovery collaboration. It's one of the few examples of a Web-based tool accessible by the public and designed to integrate into the daily workflow of biology/chemistry teams. Recently, CDD held its [3rd Annual Community Meeting](http://collaborativedrug.com/blog/blog/2009/06/10/save-the-date-3rd-annual-cdd-community-meeting-oct-1-2009/), and [Barry Bunin](http://www.collaborativedrug.com/pages/management), CDD's founder, forwarded me a link to a [writeup of the event](http://researchscorecard.com/blog/archives/262).

CDD is interesting at a number of levels. I'm most intrigued by how CDD has embraced the Web as a platform for scientific collaboration. It's also interesting to see [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) being used in the context of a large scientific application.

I don't see much written about CDD by users themselves (which is a little surprising), but I think there's a lot these folks can teach developers about how to create chemistry-focused Web applications.

If you're a CDD user, how do you use the service and what are your likes/dislikes?
