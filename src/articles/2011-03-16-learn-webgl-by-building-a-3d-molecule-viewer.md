Are you curious about [WebGL](http://www.khronos.org/webgl/wiki/Main_Page) and want to learn more? The [Signals Blog](http://blog.metamolecular.com), is running a series of tutorials on [WebGL for Chemistry](http://blog.metamolecular.com/articles/2011/03/07/webgl-for-chemistry-part-1-introduction/).

The goal: build a 3D molecular viewer for the Web browser using WebGL and no plugins. Each lesson builds on the last one, leading - hopefully - to an MIT-licensed component suitable for further open- or closed-source development.

This is a bit of a high-wire act as I have little previous experience programming 3D graphics or OpenGL, although I have some experience building complex JavaScript applications. I'll be learning about WebGL just as much as everyone else reading - if not more, so comments and feedback are most welcome.

[Running examples](http://metamolecular.github.com/webgl-chem/) are available online, so you can easily test each lesson's code with your browser of choice. [The complete source](https://github.com/metamolecular/webgl-chem) for all lessons is also available.

The series so far consists of:

1.  [WebGL for Chemistry Part 1: Introduction](http://blog.metamolecular.com/articles/2011/03/07/webgl-for-chemistry-part-1-introduction/)
2.  [WebGL for Chemistry Part 2: Displaying a Sphere in a View](http://blog.metamolecular.com/articles/2011/03/15/web-gl-for-chemistry-part-2-displaying-a-sphere-in-a-view/)
