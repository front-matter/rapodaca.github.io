If you haven't had a chance to do so yet, [IMS Health's](http://imshealth.com) recent [Intelligence.360](http://www.imshealth.com/ims/portal/front/articleC/0,2777,6599_40183881_81567488,00.html) on the global pharmaceutical industry is worth reading. One noteworthy set of data contained in the report is a list of the top ten best-selling drugs worldwide for 2006.

A list of chemical names and numbers by itself is not that useful. However, adding chemical structures has a way of prompting better questions and generating many more ideas. In that spirit, I've created an online table of the ten best-selling drugs worldwide for 2006. This table contains the 2D chemical structure, generic name, trade name, global sales in US$, company, and indication for each drug.

A new software package codenamed "Firefly" was used to generate the chemical structures in the table. Firefly is a lightweight 2D editor and rendering library written in Java. A series of articles on Firefly can be found on Depth-First.

[This link](/images/posts/20070725/ten-best-selling-drugs-worldwide-with-structures.html) takes you to the table.
