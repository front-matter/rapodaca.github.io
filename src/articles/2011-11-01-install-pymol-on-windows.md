[PyMOL](http://pymol.org) is relatively simple to install on Windows. [The tutorial](/pymol-tutorials/pymol-essentials-tutorial/install-pymol-on-windows/) shows how.

This video is the second lesson of what I hope will become a free introductory [online video course on PyMOL](http://depth-first.com/pymol/) that will be hosted right here. Comments and suggestions are welcome.
