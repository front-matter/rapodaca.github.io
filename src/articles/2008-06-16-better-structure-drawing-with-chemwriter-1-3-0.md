[ChemWriter](http://metamolecular.com/chemwriter/) 1.3.0 has been released and is ready for [download](http://metamolecular.com/downloads/). This version makes it possible to change the mouse cursor hover radius for more accurate drawing. It also adds a setting to disable heteroatom keyboard shortcut events occurring away from a molecule node, reducing the possibility of an off-atom label being inadvertently drawn.
