[The latest version of the CTFile format specification](http://www.symyx.com/downloads/public/ctfile/ctfile.pdf) is now available for download. This version, printed in June 2010, covers both the widely-used V2000 molfile format and the newer V3000 format.

The specification references no fewer than six times another document titled *Symyx Chemical Representation*, which apparently contains important information for implementing molfile readers/writers. Unfortunately, I  have not been able to locate it anywhere.
