[WebSpex](/articles/2008/07/17/javascript-for-cheminformatics-an-introduction-to-webspex-a-spectroscopy-tool-for-the-internet/) was an idea for a 100% JavaScript spectroscopy and chromatography tool. At [Metamolecular](http://metamolecular.com), we've been turning this basic concept into reality.

Spex, our codename for this new software, is now capable of reading JCAMP-DX files and presenting them graphically within a Web browser - no plugins needed. Spex runs on all browsers we've tested, including IE6.

The [full story on Spex](http://blog.metamolecular.com/articles/2011/03/08/plugin-free-spectrum-and-chromatograph-analysis-for-the-web-browser-preview-of-spex-and-chromatogray-/) is available from the [Signals blog](http://blog.metamolecular.com/).
