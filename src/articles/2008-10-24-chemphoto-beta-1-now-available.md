[ChemPhoto](http://metamolecular.com/chemphoto), the [chemical structure imaging application](/articles/2008/09/08/smarter-cheminformatics-from-sd-file-to-image-collection-with-chemphoto) developed by [Metamolecular](http://metamolecular.com), is now available in its first beta release.

If you need to generate lots of 2D chemical structure images, ChemPhoto was designed to make your work much easier. For example:

- **Generate clear, readable 2D chemical structures at any resolution.** ChemPhoto offers fine-grained control over the appearance of your chemical structures through an extensive array of rendering options.
- **Eliminate guesswork with a what-you-see-is-what-you-get user interface.** Graphical controls let you manipulate drawing settings in real-time to get exactly the appearance you're looking for.
- **Automatically create 2D chemical structure images in your preferred format.** ChemPhoto supports both raster (PNG, JPG) and vector (SVG, EPS) image formats, eliminating the need for batch conversions. You can even bundle the output in a compressed archive for easy transport.
- **Work quickly and easily, even with very large SD files.** ChemPhoto was designed to work well even with SD files containing hundreds of thousands of structures.
- **Choose your platform.** ChemPhoto runs on all modern operating systems including Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux.
