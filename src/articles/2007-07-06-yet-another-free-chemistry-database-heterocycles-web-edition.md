Yet another [free chemistry database](http://depth-first.com/articles/2007/01/24/thirty-two-free-chemistry-databases) comes in the form of a service run by the journal [*Heterocycles*](https://www2.heterocycles.jp). The [Heterocycles Web Edition](https://www2.heterocycles.jp/journal/index.html) offers two ways to search for heterocylic ring systems: [by structure](https://www2.heterocycles.jp/FMPro?-db=gate.fp5&-format=/w2/structure.html&-view) or [by synthesis](https://www2.heterocycles.jp/FMPro?-db=gate.fp5&-format=/w2/synthesis.html&-view).

You may assume that these services would only search the contents of *Heterocycles*. It would then be a pleasant surprise to find a number of highly-regarded journals being covered. Here are some of titles:

-  Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl.
-  Chem. Eur. J.
-  Eur. J. Org. Chem.
-  Heterocycles
-  J. Am. Chem. Soc.
-  J. Med. Chem.
-  J. Nat. Prod. 
-  J. Org. Chem.
-  Org. Lett.
-  Synlett
-  Tetrahedron
-  Tetrahedron Lett.

The current query interface supports text only, although a number of important criteria can be used. I haven't searched for many heterocyles, but my results for *indolizidine* give a flavor for what you might expect (the actual number of hits was 115):

It would be interesting to know how *Heterocycles* populated its database. Is it text-mining, manual curation, both, or something else? Regardless of how it's done, Heterocycles Web Edition is definitely worth looking at.
