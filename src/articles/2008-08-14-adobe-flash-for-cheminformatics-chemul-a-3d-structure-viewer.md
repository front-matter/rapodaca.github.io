[Previous articles](http://depth-first.com/articles/tag/flash) have discussed the use of Adobe Flash for cheminformatics. [Tetsuya Hoshi](http://www.javac.jp/) has created a 3D structure viewer (embedded above) called [Chemul](http://hossy.net/chemul/) that can be used with the Flash Player and which is written in [ActionScript 3.0](http://livedocs.adobe.com/flash/9.0/ActionScriptLangRefV3/). Although the documentation is written in Japanese, it appears that Chemul supports multiple display options, as evidenced [here](http://www.javac.jp/flash/molecular/moleculardraw003/index.html).
