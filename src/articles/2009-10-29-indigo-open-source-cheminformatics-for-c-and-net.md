Dmitry Pavlov of [SciTouch](http://scitouch.net) writes in to announce the availability of [Indigo](http://opensource.scitouch.net/indigo/), an open source suite of cheminformatics tools. Indigo offers an impressive array of capabilities, including graph matching, cycle perception, structure rendering, fingerprinting. The site documentation also indicates that work on interfaces to other languages, including Ruby and Java, is planned.

It appears that Indigo has taken a different approach in some areas such as [fingerprint generation](/articles/2008/10/02/fast-substructure-search-using-open-source-tools-part-1-fingerprints-and-databases), making the toolkit worth checking out regardless of your development platform of choice.
