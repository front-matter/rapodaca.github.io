The first beta version of [MX 1.0](http://metamolecular.com/mx/) has been released. MX is a lightweight cheminformatics toolkit written in Java that emphasizes efficiency, modularity, and readability. Incorporating many changes, this release introduces support for query atoms and [Superatoms](/articles/2009/06/10/dark-corners-of-the-molfile-specification-sgroups-and-substructure-abbreviations).

Fully supported MX features include:

-  Substructure search and atom mapping based on the VF algorithm
-  Exhaustive ring perception based on the Hanser algorithm
-  Flexible query atom support
-  Depth-First traversal
-  Implicit hydrogen detection
-  Complete system of atomic masses and isotopes based on the IUPAC Technical Report.
-  Model objects (Molecule, Atom, Bond, Superatom) based on MDL CTfile specification
-  Molfile reader and writer
-  SD File reader and writer

A beta period of about 1-2 weeks is anticipated before release of version 1.0. If you find a bug, a [report](http://github.com/metamolecular/mx/issues) would be greatly appreciated.
