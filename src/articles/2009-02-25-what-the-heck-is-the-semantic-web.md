[Egon Willighagen](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/) has been posting an interesting series of articles on the use of RDF in chemistry, the latest being [this one](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2009/02/solubility-data-in-bioclipse-2-handling.html). Being totally ignorant of what RDF is and why it's important, I challenged Egon to offer a simple explanation, preferably in the form of a video, graphic, or short paragraph.

In the meantime, I started doing my own digging. I found what I was looking for. But to put it in proper context, it's first important to understand what this [Semantic Web thing](/articles/2008/04/30/just-a-flesh-wound) really is.

Enjoy!

P.S. How hard could it be to come up with something similar to this video for explaining InChI and InChI Key?
