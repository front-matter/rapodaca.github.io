Depending on the audience and medium, chemical structures can be presented in a variety of styles. [Chemical structure imaging applications](http://depth-first.com/articles/2008/09/08/smarter-cheminformatics-from-sd-file-to-image-collection-with-chemphoto) should make it easy to visually and/or numerically arrive at the best appearance. [ChemPhoto](http://metamolecular.com/chemphoto) makes it easy to get exactly the right look for your structures through what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG) drawing settings.

The screenshots below illustrate the three main categories of drawing settings in ChemPhoto: Atoms; Bonds; and Images. As each setting is manipulated, the entire view is updated in real-time to reflect the changes. A set of changes can be rolled back by pressing the "Cancel" button, making it easy to undo unwanted modifications.
