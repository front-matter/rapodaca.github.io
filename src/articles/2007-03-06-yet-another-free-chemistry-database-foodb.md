[FooDB](http://hmdb.med.ualberta.ca/foodb/) contains over 1,900 structures used as food additives in the United States. The data in FooDB are provided by the [FDA EAFUS site](http://vm.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/eafus.html). You can search by CAS number, IUPAC name, or molecular formula. And in what is likely to be a trend to watch closely, FooDB is powered by the Web application framework [Ruby on Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.org/).

FooDB is not alone: the number of [free chemistry databases on the Web](http://depth-first.com/articles/2007/01/24/thirty-two-free-chemistry-databases) just keeps growing. How this trend ultimately plays out is anybody's guess.

One thing is clear: the point is rapidly approaching at which database aggregation technologies will start to matter. No chemist wants to search through over thirty databases to find the information they need on a molecule. They want it delivered in one quick, intuitive, user-friendly package. Here's another example of something that's [broken](http://depth-first.com/articles/tag/broken) in cheminformatics. Like all broken things, it's the source of great frustration for users and great opportunity for developers.
