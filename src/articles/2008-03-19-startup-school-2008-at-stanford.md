[Startup School](http://startupschool.org/) is set to take place again this year on April 19<sup>th</sup> at Stanford University. Having gone last year, I can say it was well worth it. The one day event was a great chance to meet people with all levels of experience in starting companies. The speakers were amazing.

The [speaker lineup](http://startupschool.org/speakers.html) looks at least as good as the one last year and includes Marc Andreessen (Netscape), Michael Arrington (TechCrunch), Jeff Bezos (Amazon), and David Heinemeier Hansson (37signals/Rails). Even so, some of the best speakers from last year were [the ones not so well known](http://depth-first.com/articles/2007/05/14/scientific-publication-and-the-seven-deadly-sins).

If you're interested, you can [apply to attend the event](http://apps.ycombinator.com/susapply) until March 23<sup>rd</sup>.
