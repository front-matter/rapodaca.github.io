Chemistry apps for mobile devices are starting to get a lot of attention lately (for a larger list, see <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/swain/Macinchem/iPhone/mobile_apps.html">the Mac in Chemistry article</a>). I can't vouch for either one of these apps because I haven't used them, but they do raise some interesting questions and possibilities.
