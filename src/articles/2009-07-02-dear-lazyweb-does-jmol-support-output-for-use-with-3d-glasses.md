After having spent some time recently [playing around](http://zusammen.metamolecular.com/2009/07/02/sixty-four-free-chemistry-databases-part-19-grokking-molecular-symmetry-with-symmetry-otterbein) with [Jmol](http://jmol.sourceforge.net/), the thought occurs - is there a setting that enables 3D-effect viewing with those colored glassed used with movies?

For that matter, which of the free 3D molecule viewers currenly available support it?
