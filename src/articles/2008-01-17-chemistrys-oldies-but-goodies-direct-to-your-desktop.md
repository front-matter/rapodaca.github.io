[Google Books](http://books.google.com/) has digitized a large number of older, hard-to-find chemistry journals. Given that the shelf-life of a chemistry experimental is [measured in centuries](/articles/2006/09/03/peculiarities-of-chemical-information), this may be a useful alternative to the traditional interlibrary loan.

Although the user interface for Google Books should be an embarrassment to a company with Google's resources and reputation, the content is indispensable.

The expiration of copyright for the older chemical literature is an excellent opportunity for those wanting to preserve this vital research and historical resource.
