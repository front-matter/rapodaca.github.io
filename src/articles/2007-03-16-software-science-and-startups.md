[Startup School](http://startupschool.org/) brings together hackers interested in building new companies. I'll be headed to this year's event, which takes place at Stanford University on March 24th. The speaker linup includes [Paul Graham](http://paulgraham.com/bio.html) (Viaweb/Yahoo Store), [Mitchell Kapor](http://www.kapor.com/bio/index.html) (Lotus), and [Paul Bucheit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Buchheit) (Gmail). If you'll be in the neighborhood and would be interested in talking software, science, or startups, I'd like to [hear from you](mailto:rich_apodaca@yahoo.com).
