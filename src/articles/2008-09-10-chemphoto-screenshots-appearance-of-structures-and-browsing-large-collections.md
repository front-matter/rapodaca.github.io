Chemical structure imaging software solves the problem of how to easily create large numbers of readable chemical structures in a variety of formats automatically. [ChemPhoto](http://metamolecular.com/chemphoto) was recently [introduced](http://depth-first.com/articles/2008/09/08/smarter-cheminformatics-from-sd-file-to-image-collection-with-chemphoto) as what appears to be the first chemical structure imaging application. With development of the ChemPhoto user interface now in full-swing, it's possible to show some screenshots.

Below are two screenshots in which around 25,000 structures from [PubChem](http://depth-first.com/articles/2006/09/29/hacking-pubchem-direct-access-with-ftp) have been loaded.
