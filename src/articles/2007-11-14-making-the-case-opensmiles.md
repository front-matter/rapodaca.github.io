[SMILES](http://www.daylight.com/dayhtml/doc/theory/theory.smiles.html) is one of the most widely-used line notations in cheminformatics. Yet until very recently, there has been no concerted attempt to develop open SMILES encoding standards.

[OpenSMILES](http://www.opensmiles.org/) aims to change that. By providing a forum in which concerns from the SMILES user community can be voiced, peer-reviewed, and addressed, OpenSMILES introduces a new way for the SMILES language to become better.

[A draft OpenSMILES specification](http://www.opensmiles.org/spec/open-smiles.html) is now available for review. For now, the best way to raise issues and otherwise get involved is through the [OpenSMILES mailing list](https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/blueobelisk-smiles).
