The next salvo in the ongoing battle to decide whether the Federal Government should be in the scientific publishing business has been fired. [H.R. 6845](http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c110:H.R.6845:) seeks to preempt the [recently-passed law](http://depth-first.com/articles/2008/03/18/crunch-time-can-nih-grant-recipients-still-publish-in-acs-journals) (PL 110-161) requiring recipients of NIH funding to deposit copies of their peer-reviewed manuscripts into [PubMed Central](http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/).

The move is hardly surprising. The aim of PL 110-161 was on face value to promote Open Access. In practice, it created a government agency charged with publishing scholarly manuscripts based in part on value added by scientific publishers. Regardless of your views on the subject, it's [pretty easy to see](http://depth-first.com/articles/2008/06/03/acs-responds-to-request-for-information-on-the-new-nih-public-access-policy) how publishers view this as a fight they can't afford to lose.

The problem is that the publishers' cause has already been lost; H.R. 6845 is merely a sideshow. The same process that gutted traditional music publishers and newspapers is now working on the scientific publication industry. Make no mistake - those journals disappearing from your libraries and Web browsers are the sign of an industry in trouble.

This leaves us with a question I'd pose to all Open Access proponents: What does a future in which even the wealthiest scientific publishers are going out of business look like?

That's the thing to focus on.
