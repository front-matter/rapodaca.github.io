[Foldit](http://fold.it) is a multiplayer video game with the goal of solving unsolved structural biology problems. It's an example of what [Louis Van Ahn](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~biglou/) calls ['Games with a Purpose'](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~biglou/ieee-gwap.pdf). Recently Foldit players helped [solve the crystal structure M-PMV retroviral protease](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nsmb.2119).

Foldit is quite playable and enjoyable in its own right, at least on the training levels I worked through. One of the pleasant surprises is that players are given a variety of automated tools for energy minimization - they don't need to rotate every bond themselves. The game also does an excellent job of presenting the goal in a graphical way.

These and other factors move the gameplay into the level of thinking and strategy - and a genuinely fun experience.
