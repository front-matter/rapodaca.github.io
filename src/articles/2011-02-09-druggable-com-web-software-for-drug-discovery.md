[Drugable.com](http://drugable.com) is an early-stage, NLM-funded collaboration to build a web-based drug discovery platform. Closed beta is expected to begin in March of 2011. If you view the Web as the natural platform for collaboration in drug discovery, Drugable.com and projects like it will no doubt offer a wealth of lessons to learn from.
