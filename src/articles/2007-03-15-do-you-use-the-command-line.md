By typing an address into the address bar. When we want to go to the mail "application", we type in "gmail.com"; when we want to open a news "application", we type in "nytimes.com". On the old unix command lines, we would type type "pine" and "rn". See a similarity? The address bar is just a primitive command line. A command line that your grandmother can—and does—use.

The command line is alive and well. It's simply become so sophisticated that most of us don't realize we're using it. Whether we're entering a URL into a browser address bar, taking advantage of autocomplete to look up a co-worker's name in an address book, or using Google to search the Web, the command line is hard at work. Most people wouldn't want it any other way.

To an end user, a command line is nothing more than a box to enter text. The magic happens when this text is processed. Aza Raskin's company [Humanized](http://humanized.com) uses this simple idea to build text-driven applications that save time and effort. 

What would happen if the same thinking were applied to chemical informatics?
