In a move likely to up the ante in the emerging [Open Source Drug Discovery](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nrd2131) movement, GlaxoSmithKline have [announced](http://us.gsk.com/html/media-news/pressreleases/2008/2008_us_pressrelease_10097.htm) the donation of genomic profiling data for over 300 cancer cell lines to the [National Cancer Institute's cancer Bioinformatics Grid](https://cabig.nci.nih.gov/) (caBIG).

According to [NCI's FAQ](https://cabig.nci.nih.gov/faqs/index_html), caBIG is "an open-source, open-access information network enabling cancer researchers to share tools, data, applications, and technologies according to agreed-upon standards and identified needs." caBIG is comprised of publicly-available datasets and open source software tools designed to interact with them.

This move has potential significance on a number of levels:

-  Large pharmaceutical companies haven't generally made a habit out of donating their hard-earned raw intellectual property on this scale. For something this far outside the industry norm, nobody wants to go first; GSK's actions have made the practice a little more respectable.
-  caBIG is simultaneously a publicly-accessible database, a set of open data specifications, and an open source software platform. In other words, it's striving to become an end-to-end solution to the problem of open collaboration in the biological sciences.
-  Donating raw data directly into an open repository bypasses the established scientific publication model in which data are communicated only as part of a peer-reviewed publication. Should this new publication model continue to gain popularity, it would fundamentally change the way science is conducted.
