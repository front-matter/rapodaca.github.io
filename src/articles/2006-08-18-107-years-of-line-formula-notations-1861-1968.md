>Thus, within the short period of just seven years after the birth of structural chemistry in 1861, virtually all of the main ideas relating to line-formula descriptions were conceived and published. No basically new practices appeared for some 79 years. Then, within an identically brief period of just seven years (1947-1954), virtually all of the fundamental features of structure-delineating chemical notations appeared in the international chemical literature.

Apparently, advances in chemical line notations have a history of occurring in clusters. Perhaps the development of <a href="http://www.iupac.org/inchi/">InChI</a> will spawn a renaissance in the development and use of line notations. Is there room (or need) for multiple line notation languages, each filling a particular niche, or can a universal line notation ever be developed? Will currently popular line notations such as <a href="http://www.daylight.com/dayhtml/doc/theory/theory.smiles.html">SMILES</a> and InChI seem as cumbersome in 30 years as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006CK33G/sr=8-1/qid=1155873116/ref=sr_1_1/102-3132294-7762550?ie=UTF8">Wiswesser Line Notation</a> does today?
