**The Problem:** A Web page has many chemical names, but no structures.

**The Solution:** Paste the page's URL into [Chemicalize](http://chemicalize.org). The page looks the same, but when you hover over a substance name, you get a popup showing the structure (and a link to a structure summary page).

Pretty cool, huh?
