The applications of graphs in cheminformatics are numerous. From modeling molecules themselves to reaction networks, to ring system indicies, and even scientific paper authorship relationships, graphs are **the way** most problems get framed.

Wouldn't it be great if your natural mental model of a problem didn't have to change just because you needed persistent storage of the underlying data?

[Neo4j](http://neo4j.org/), a high-performance, transactional, embedded graph database written in Java, offers what appears to be the best solution to this gnarly problem I've ever seen.
