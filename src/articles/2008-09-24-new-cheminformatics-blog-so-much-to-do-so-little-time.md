If you're into cheminformatics and like well-written analysis, [Rajarshi Guha's new blog](http://rguha.wordpress.com/) is well worth reading. Rajarshi is a longtime contributor to the world of open source cheminformatics, including the [CDK](http://cdk.sourceforge.net/) and [Open Babel](http://openbabel.org/wiki/Main_Page) projects. His interest in the quantitative side of cheminformatics is apparent in recent articles on [faster substructure search](http://rguha.wordpress.com/2008/09/19/faster-substructure-search-in-the-cdk/), [faster fingerprinting](http://rguha.wordpress.com/2008/09/12/faster-fingerprinting/), and [CDK performance](http://rguha.wordpress.com/2008/09/11/cdk-performance-measurements/).
