The second beta version of [ChemPhoto](http://metamolecular.com/chemphoto), the [chemical structure imaging application](/articles/2008/09/08/smarter-cheminformatics-from-sd-file-to-image-collection-with-chemphoto) developed by [Metamolecular](http://metamolecular.com), is now available for testing.

Thanks to detailed reports from several [ChemPhoto Beta-1 testers](/articles/2008/10/24/chemphoto-beta-1-now-available), a number of issues were discovered and have been addressed by this newest release.
