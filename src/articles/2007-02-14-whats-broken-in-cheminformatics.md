A while back, [Seth Godin](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/) gave [a talk](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2006/08/this_is_broken_.html) on things that are broken, why they are broken, and why they stay broken ([video](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-4101280286098310645&hl=en)). Seth is one of those rare speakers who can entertain and inform at the same time. I especially liked how his talk identifies seven (maybe more) reasons for brokenness.

As I watched Seth's talk, it wasn't hard to think of many examples in which chem(o|i)informatics is broken. Of course, the way you feel about something being broken depends on your perspective. It's far too easy to become cynical when dealing with the frustration of broken things. But for anyone wanting to do research that matters or build useful products, things that are broken are like manna from heaven.
