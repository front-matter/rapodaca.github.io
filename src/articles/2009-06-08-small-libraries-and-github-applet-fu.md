If you've ever needed to deploy Java applets, you may have found the information on best practices scattered, inconsistent, and unreliable. [Applet-Fu](http://github.com/metamolecular/applet-fu/tree/master) is a small JavaScript library that makes it easy to deploy applets by taking advantage of Web standards and features already supported by mainstream browsers.

[More detailed discussion](http://products.metamolecular.com/2009/06/08/better-applet-deployment-with-applet-fu) of Applet-Fu is available from the [Metamolecular Products Blog](http://products.metamolecular.com) and the [ChemWriter Best Practices Deployment Page](http://chemwriter.com/articles/deployment-best-practices).

Applet-Fu is a perfect example of the kind of open source project for which a service like SourceForge is overkill. The library consists of nothing more than a few lines of JavaScript in a single file, and some documentation. For this reason, Applet-Fu is [hosted on GitHub](http://github.com/metamolecular/applet-fu/tree/master).

The project itself took about 60 seconds to create and upload. Perks include:

- [issue tracking](http://github.com/metamolecular/applet-fu/issues) easily integrated into source code management workflow
- [easy forking and re-merging](http://github.com/guides/fork-a-project-and-submit-your-modifications) so that independent development efforts can be co-ordinated with minimal overhead
- [highlighted source code](http://github.com/metamolecular/applet-fu/blob/1919bc2883f98afa0524451f13423ed70470723c/applet-fu.js) right in your browser
- [graphical overview of development activity](http://github.com/metamolecular/applet-fu/network)
- [stay up to date](http://github.com/metamolecular/applet-fu/watchers) without subscribing to yet another mailing list

There are many other ways to host open source projects, and GitHub won't be right in every situation. But for small, highly-focused projects, GitHub is well worth checking out.
