Yesterday's post on [cheminformatics benchmarking](/articles/2008/12/04/choose-java-for-speed) generated a number of interesting comments, both here and [on a similar article](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2008/12/who-says-java-is-not-fast.html) posted to [Egon Willighagen's blog](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/).

One thing the discussion highlights is the need for a suite of benchmarks specifically aimed at comparing the performance of diverse cheminformatics toolkits under controlled conditions. Toward this end, Egon has set up a [GitHub](/articles/2008/11/25/goodbye-subversion-hello-git-and-github) project called [cheminfbenchmark](http://github.com/egonw/cheminfbenchmark/tree), with my own fork of it appearing [here](http://github.com/rapodaca/cheminfbenchmark/).

If you wanted to create a fair and balanced benchmark suite, how would you do it? What tests would you include, how would you run them, how would you select the test data, and how would you report the results?
