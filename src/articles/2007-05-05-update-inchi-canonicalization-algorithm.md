An [older article](/articles/2006/08/12/inchi-canonicalization-algorithm) on the InChI canonicalization algorithm has been restored and updated. The revised article contains a direct link to the [InChI Technical Manual](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=142870&package_id=217748) pdf file which I uploaded to SourceForge for convenience.
