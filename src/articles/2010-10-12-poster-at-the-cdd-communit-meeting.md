Are you involved in Drug Discovery? Are you interested in how new technologies could change the rules of the game? Will you be in San Francisco on October 21st?

Then you might consider registering (free) for the [4th Annual Collaborative Drug Discovery Community Meeting](http://www.acteva.com/booking.cfm?bevaID=204012&CFID=25637656&CFTOKEN=61705806). This will be my first CDD Community Meeting, but I'm looking forward to it. Past meetings have brought together a diverse group from science, business, and philanthropy - and this meeting looks set to do the same.

My poster will be on a cheminformatics-related topic - so feel free to stop by and say "hi"!
