It's been said before but bears repeating: [social networking is a feature, not a destination](http://www.thelongtail.com/the_long_tail/2007/09/social-networki.html). One service that demonstrates this principle very well is [GitHub](http://github.com), which not only lets you keep track of specific repositories a given developer is maintaining, but their activity on GitHub in general. This can be very useful in finding new software, learning about new approaches, and meeting other developers that share your interests.

Over the last few months, I've noticed a steady increase in cheminformatics developers using GitHub. Because GitHub doesn't make it very easy to find them (searching by 'cheminformatics' doesn't turn up much), I thought it might be useful to compile a list of them here. In no particular order, they are:
