title: Solving Organic Chemistry's Oldest Problem
summary: "According to a recent editorial by Rick Danheiser, 3-5% of the procedures submitted for review by Organic Syntheses are rejected \"due to the inability of the checkers to satisfactorily reproduce the results of their submitters.\" During the period 1982-2005 the rejection rate was about 12%."

According to [a recent editorial by Rick Danheiser](http://www.orgsyn.org/orgsyn/pdfs/v88p0001.pdf), 3-5% of the procedures submitted for review by [Organic Syntheses](http://www.orgsyn.org/) are rejected "due to the inability of the checkers to satisfactorily reproduce the results of their submitters." During the period 1982-2005 the rejection rate was about 12%.

*Organic Syntheses* was [founded](http://www.orgsyn.org/about.asp) to address organic chemistry's oldest and most persistent problem - documenting and reproducing synthetic procedures. From Danheiser's editorial, it's clear that more work, and possibly a better approach, is needed.

# Worse Than It Looks

A failure rate of 3-12% may sound small, but consider the pool from which *Organic Syntheses* draws. To even be [considered](http://www.orgsyn.org/submission.html) for checking in the lab of an [Editorial Board member](http://orgsyn.org/boe.asp), a [proposal outline](http://www.orgsyn.org/OS_Proposal_Cover_Sheet.pdf) must first be submitted by an outside author. If the proposal meets the standards of the board, a full procedure is invited. Another round of review then takes place. Only if approved by the board will the procedure be checked.

This rigorous pre-screening process means that authors must have a great deal of confidence in a submitted procedure *before* it's checked. The denominator in the figure Danheiser cites most likely represents the very best of what organic synthesis can offer.

Despite this rigorous selection and review process, 3-12% of procedures have historically failed the *Organic Syntheses* reproducibility test. Why?

Danheiser's editorial ends with a teaser: "Part 2 of this editorial will discuss the most common causes of problems based on the experiences of the Board of Editors." Unfortunately, this follow-up doesn't appear to have been published yet.

# Solving the Problem

*Organic Syntheses* has co-evolved over the last several decades alongside the peer-reviewed scientific publication system. But with the widespread use of the Web and other information technologies, that system is [changing](/articles/2012/01/28/george-whitesides-the-concept-of-the-scientific-paper-is-eroding-before-our-very-eyes/) - fast.

Could there be a fundamentally faster and more efficient way to publish and vet synthetic organic procedures than the system we have now?

Despite some [points to consider](/articles/2013/02/22/anonymous-science-and-the-survival-of-blogsyn/), the [Blog Syn](http://blog-syn.blogspot.com/) initiative and others likely to follow have a chance to make significant inroads into organic chemistry's oldest problem.
