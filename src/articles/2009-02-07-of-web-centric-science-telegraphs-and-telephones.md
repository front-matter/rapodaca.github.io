Could it be that both [Open Access](http://depth-first.com/articles/2006/11/16/electric-cars-and-open-access) and [Electronic Laboratory Notebooks](http://depth-first.com/articles/2009/01/02/the-electronic-laboratory-notebook-trap) are examples of telephone-like capabilities being used to make a better telegraph?

[Web-Centric Science](http://depth-first.com/articles/2009/02/04/web-centric-science) offers a set of features orthoginal to those of paper-centric science. Creating the new system in the image of the old one misses the point, and the opportunity, entirely.
