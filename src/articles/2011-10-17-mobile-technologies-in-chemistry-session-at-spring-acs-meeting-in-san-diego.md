Are you creating a chemistry mobile app or eBook? Are you using mobile technologies in chemical research or education settings? Do you have an interesting story to tell?

If so, you're invited to share your story at the [Spring 2012 American Chemical Society Meeting](http://portal.acs.org/portal/PublicWebSite/meetings/spring2012/index.htm) in lovely San Diego, California. There, I'll be hosting a session titled "Mobile Space and E-Books". Presentations will be 25 minutes long with ten minutes reserved for questions and answers.

[Submit your abstract](http://abstracts.acs.org/) through the ACS meeting system by *October 22, 2011*. If you're unsure whether your topic would be a good fit, feel free to [contact me directly](/about/).
