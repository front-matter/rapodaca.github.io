Anyone trying to develop a commercially viable [electronic laboratory notebook](http://depth-first.com/articles/2009/01/02/the-electronic-laboratory-notebook-trap) system needs to address the single biggest usability issue facing this approach: hardware.

Mobile devices are not only getting cheaper and more powerful, but they are practically begging for laboratory notebook-like applications to be built specifically for them. Their chocolate-bar form factors, low startup latency, and pin-sharp graphics make them intriguing candidates to replace awkward laptops and tablet computers in chemically-hostile environments.

The problem is that the mobile device industry is still in its infancy; unlike laptops and desktops, there is still plenty of room for newcomers to turn the market upside-down. Fewer things are more discouraging to a potential application developer.

One approach is to view mobile devices as just another consumer of Web resources and stick to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript customized for a mobile form factor. The downside is that certain kinds of services that might be quite useful in a laboratory - such as a camera - might not be available through a browser-based client.

Fortunately, there is an alternative - [Titanium Mobile](http://www.appcelerator.com/products/titanium-mobile/). This platform enables developers to write a single version of their application in JavaScript/CSS/HTML that gets compiled to native binaries for both [iPhone](http://www.apple.com/iphone/) and [Android](http://www.android.com/#utm_campaign=en&utm_source=en-ha-na-us-bk&utm_medium=ha&utm_term=android) mobile devices.

I haven't yet used Titanium Mobile, but plan to do so in the next few weeks. If you have a small laboratory application that could benefit from software written for a mobile device platform, I'd like to <a href="http://mailhide.recaptcha.net/d?k=01URsbe5hlgIa0Q7SqrDxHhg==&amp;c=5qVtXX6rtaltBPWbt7naSVbDfkPztIB5u3mVQgFdbKs=" onclick="window.open('http://mailhide.recaptcha.net/d?k=01URsbe5hlgIa0Q7SqrDxHhg==&amp;c=5qVtXX6rtaltBPWbt7naSVbDfkPztIB5u3mVQgFdbKs=', '', 'toolbar=0,scrollbars=0,location=0,statusbar=0,menubar=0,resizable=0,width=500,height=300'); return false;" title="Reveal this e-mail address">hear from you</a>.
