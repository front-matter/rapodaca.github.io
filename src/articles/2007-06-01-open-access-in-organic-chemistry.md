In a recent interview, [Peter Murray-Rust](http://wwmm.ch.cam.ac.uk/blogs/murrayrust/?p=348) offers some very interesting [comments](http://blogs.talis.com/nodalities/2007/05/peter_murrayrust_talks_with_ta.php) on Open Access in chemistry. [Beilstein Journal of Organic Chemistry](http://bjoc.beilstein-journals.org/) remains the only widely-available Open Access option for chemical publication backed by a major publisher. With these thoughts in mind, I offer an update to my previous [compilation](/articles/2006/11/16/electric-cars-and-open-access) of their statistics.
