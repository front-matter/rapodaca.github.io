Welcome to [Wikipedia](http://web.archive.org/web/20010517002121/http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/Wikipedia)! We're writing a complete encyclopedia from scratch, collaboratively. We started work in January 2001. We've got over 6,000 pages already. We want to make over 100,000. So, let's get to work! Write a little (or a lot) about what you know. Read our welcome message here: [Welcome, newcomers](http://web.archive.org/web/20010517002121/http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/Welcome,_newcomers)!
