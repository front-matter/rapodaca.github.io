[The Columbus Dispatch](http://www.dispatch.com) reported yesterday that an [Ohio jury had decided against the ACS](http://www.dispatch.com/live/content/local_news/stories/2008/03/27/leadscope.html?sid=101) for $27 million in a dispute with the founders of [Leadscope, Inc.](http://www.leadscope.com/)

The case was a countersuit by Leadscope, who alleged that Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) had damaged their company in pursuing an earlier lawsuit. That original suit claimed that the founders of Leadscope, who were former CAS employees, had used intellectual property belonging to CAS in the development of their products.

Some background on the original case is available in [*Am. Chem. Soc. v. Leadscope, Inc.*](http://www.sconet.state.oh.us/rod/docs/pdf/10/2005/2005-ohio-2557.pdf)
