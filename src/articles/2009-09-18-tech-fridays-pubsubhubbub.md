[PubSubHubbub](http://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/) is a "simple, open, server-to-server web-hook-based pubsub (publish/subscribe) protocol as an extension to Atom (and RSS)." Although the presentation below isn't the most lucid, PubSubHubbub and other work in this area such as [XMPP](http://xmpp.org/) can be thought of as adaptations of the well-known [Observer Pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern) to a network.
