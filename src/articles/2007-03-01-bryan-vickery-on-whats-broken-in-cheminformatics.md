> ... The traditional model of publishing is sustainable, by which I mean profitable, because the academic/research community still funnels vast amounts of money into it from library budgets â€“ it is certainly not self-sustaining. The fact that libraries still pay excessive charges to access this literature shows that the market is broken, not that the toll access route is sustainable.

Bryan Vickery's interview is interesting on a number of levels, not the least of which being that it appears in an ACS publication. His comments raise the obvious question of *why* does the academic/research community continue to support existing publishing models, complaints notwithstanding. The answer to this question is the key to fixing what's broken.
