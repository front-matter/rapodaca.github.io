[OpenAstexViewer](http://openastexviewer.net/web/) is an [LGPL-licensed](http://openastexviewer.net/web/license.html) 3D molecular visualization tool written in Java. With the obfuscated jarfile weighing in at 1 MB, OpenAstexViewer could make a good choice for use in Web applications.

There are now at least two open source, feature-rich 3D molecular visualization tools written in Java (the other being [Jmol](http://jmol.sourceforge.net/)). Are there any others?
