[James Gosling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Gosling), widely credited as the creator of [Java](http://java.sun.com), will be at a [special session](http://www.sdjug.com/) of the [San Diego Java Users' Group](http://www.sdjug.com/) on August 8th. Love it or loathe it, Java has changed the direction of software development, and Gosling has been a major force behind it.

Based on the record turnout for last month's presentation by Google on the [Google Web Toolkit](http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/) (GWT), seating will be scarce. You'll also need to RSVP beforehand.

Drop me a line if you're interested in meeting there.
