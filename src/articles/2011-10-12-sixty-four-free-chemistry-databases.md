The open Web offers a rich collection of diverse chemical data sources - if you know where to look. It's been over four years since I wrote the [previous post in this series](/articles/2007/01/24/thirty-two-free-chemistry-databases/) describing some emerging chemical databases, and a lot has happened in this space. The time seems right for an update.

Although some of the original databases are no longer active, it's encouraging to see that a number of them continue to run and even prosper. It's of course likely that still more services will be created and retired in the coming years. If you know of a free chemistry database that's missing from this list, please leave a comment or [contact me directly](/about/).

Below I give you, in no particular order, a collection of free chemistry databases.
