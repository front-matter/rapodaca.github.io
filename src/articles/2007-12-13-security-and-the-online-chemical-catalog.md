[James Swetnam](http://swetnam.wordpress.com/) has an [interesting article](http://swetnam.wordpress.com/2007/12/13/why-not-to-outsource-your-web-storefront/) on security and the online chemical catalog. Apparently, the previous structure query results of a certain major retailer can be viewed by anyone, not just the person who originated them.

Chemical structure queries, like any other database query, can be very valuable information in the hands of a knowledgeable and determined competitor. Depending on the application, safeguarding structure queries can be just as important as safeguarding the structure database itself.
