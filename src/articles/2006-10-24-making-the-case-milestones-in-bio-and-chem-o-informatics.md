<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ci600240w">An article by Thomas Engel honoring Johann Gasteiger</a> has recently appeared in <em>J. Chem. Inf. Model.</em> Tucked between two pages of text is a fascinating full-color, full-page timeline of Bio- and Chem(o)informatics. It starts with the abacus in 3000 B.C. and Libavius' <em>Alchemia</em> in 1500 A.D. Near the end, it records the advent of virtual screening in 1998. Then, the very next event on this very large timeline happens in 2000 - it's the founding of the <a href="http://cdk.sf.net">CDK project</a>!
