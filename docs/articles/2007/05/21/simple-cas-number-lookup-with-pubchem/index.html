      <p><a href="http://metamolecular.com/cheminformatics/what-is-a-cas-number/">CAS Registry Numbers</a> simplify the thorny problem of referring to chemical substances. These short numerical sequences are arguably the most widely-used form of molecular identifier, appearing on reagent bottles, in publications, in patents and patent applications, and MSDS sheets.</p>
<p>During my time as a synthetic organic chemist, I would sometimes run into the problem of finding the structure of a molecule represented by a CAS number. A common case was when an ambiguous, incomprehensible, or blurred IUPAC name was printed on a reagent bottle along with a CAS number. By looking up the CAS number, I could confirm the bottle's contents.</p>
<p>Your first impulse when looking up a CAS number might be to fire up <a href="http://www.cas.org/SCIFINDER/">SciFinder</a>. For years this was the only option. Those days are quickly starting to seem as quaint as when people actually wrote on pieces of paper and dropped them in mailboxes (<a href="http://netflix.com">dropping DVDs in a mailbox</a> is a different matter).</p>
<p>A little-publicized feature of PubChem makes it an ideal way to quickly find the structure associated with a CAS Number. To use it, you need nothing more than a computer, a browser, and an internet connection.</p>
<p>Browse over to the <a href="http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">PubChem</a> welcome page. At the top you'll find a search box. Enter your CAS number and press "Go." For this example, I'm using the CAS number for 2,5-Pyrazinedicarboxylic acid dihydrate:</p>

<p>If all goes well, you should see a results screen containing the structure of your compound and a link to its summary page:</p>

<p>Does this seem a little too good to be true? Try it for yourself. Pick up a copy of the Aldrich catalog, Merck index, or anything else that lists lots of CAS numbers. Choose several structures at random and see how PubChem performs.</p>
<p>There are limitations to this method. PubChem generally doesn't index large molecules such as polymers and peptides, so they won't be found by this method. Similarly, if a CAS number doesn't point to a distinct molecular entity (e.g. "mineral oil"), PubChem won't find it either. But these are hardly limitations in the vast majority of cases.</p>
<p>With the <a href="http://www.corporate-ir.net/ireye/ir_site.zhtml?ticker=SIAL&amp;script=410&amp;layout=-6&amp;item_id=984368">recent addition of Sigma-Aldrich</a> as a PubChem compound supplier, it won't be long before smaller companies begin following suit. What we're seeing with PubChem is a classic example of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect">network effect</a>. The end result should come as a surprise to nobody.</p>
