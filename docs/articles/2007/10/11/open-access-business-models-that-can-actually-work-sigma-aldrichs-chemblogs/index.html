      <p>A gem of a chemistry blog has been operating for some time - apparently without much notice. <a href="http://chemblogs.com/sial_blog/">ChemBlogs</a> is Sigma-Aldrich's Web answer to their <a href="http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/Brands/Aldrich/Aldrichimica_Acta.html">Aldrichimica Acta</a> print magazine, and it's packed with mini-reviews on synthetic chemistry with links to the primary literature. This approach to scientific marketing has so much potential, I can't imagine why others aren't doing it.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there are some small things that could be done to make ChemBlogs a lot more effective. Here, in no particular order, are some suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Submit the RSS feed to Chemical Blogspace.</strong> <a href="http://cb.openmolecules.net/posts.php">Chemical Blogspace</a> is perhaps the most widely-read aggregator of free chemistry content on the Web. And it's one of the best ways to get your chemistry blog noticed, bookmarked, and linked to.</li>
<li><strong>Make it easier to discover and use a post's permalink.</strong> If I see an article I like in ChemBlogs, such as <a href="http://chemblogs.com/sial_blog/index.php?blog=2&amp;title=chem_gem_chloro_triphenylphosphine_gold_&amp;more=1&amp;c=1&amp;tb=1&amp;pb=1">this one on gold catalysis</a>, there's no obvious way for me to link to it in my own blog. Standard practice is that all titles on the front page are hyperlinked to the article's permalink. <a href="/articles/2007/10/03/designing-the-obvious-permalinks-and-paradigms">This article</a> discusses the importance of permalinks.</li>
<li><strong>Don't moderate comments - use reCAPTCHA instead.</strong> Nothing stifles online discussion like moderated comments. The Web is about immediacy. Make a change and see it live instantly. Everything else is so 1999. If spam is the concern, <a href="/articles/2007/09/18/six-reasons-i-like-recaptcha-or-how-to-build-a-web-service-worth-talking-about">reCAPTCHA</a> is a wonderful tool for the job.</li>
<li><strong>Drop the company group when identifying authors.</strong> No reader cares whether Sharbil J. Firsan is part of the Marketing Group or not. In fact, it's a bit of a turn-off to have the word "Marketing" appear at all.</li>
<li><strong>Each author should have an online bio that links to their name.</strong> Although titles and company divisions are not useful, other information about authors is. In a multi-author blog like ChemBlogs, the byline should hyperlink to a bio of the author, or a collection of their writing. This makes it easier for readers to follow authors they like.</li>
<li><strong>Link to the primary literature via DOI.</strong> ChemBlogs cites many articles appearing in journals, which is a great thing. Unfortunately, there's no way for a search engine to know that this is happening. The simple fix is to hyperlink a literature citation to the DOI entry, like this one for <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/cr00032a009"><em>Chem. Rev.</em> <strong>1994</strong>, <em>94</em>, 2483-2547</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Include InChIs for all important structures.</strong> Free tools like <a href="http://inchimatic.com">InChIMatic</a> can then be used to quickly find articles dealing with those molecules.</li>
<li><strong>Post more frequently and/or regularly.</strong> More content means more eyeballs. When it's regularly posted, readers know when to expect it.</li>
<li><strong>Invite some working scientists to write articles.</strong> If recent experience with <a href="/articles/2006/09/08/chemical-reviews-on-wikipedia">Wikipedia and Chemistry</a> is any guide, there are plenty of capable scientist more than willing to create free, high-quality compound monographs and other chemical content. Invite some of them to contribute very short articles for ChemBlogs in their area of expertise and see what happens.</li>
<li><strong>Release all content under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons License</a>.</strong> Information wants to be free - why not make it free? Allowing ChemBlogs' content to spread far and wide just makes it that much more visible. For example, at last count, Depth-First content was reproduced on about a dozen other Web sites, including one <a href="/articles/2007/08/31/cheminformatics-in-korean-an-example-of-scientific-self-organization">in Korean</a>. This matches my goals exactly, and it's all perfectly legal thanks to the way the content is licensed.</li>
</ul>
<p>With a little tweaking, Sigma-Aldrich's experiment in <a href="http://www.sethgodin.com/permission/">Permission Marketing</a> could pay off - for everyone. Readers would conveniently get useful bits of information to make them more productive. The Internet would get new, high-quality chemical content - free to use and link to. Who knows - this might even become an <a href="/articles/2007/07/16/go-west-young-man-does-open-access-really-matter-in-the-long-run">Open Access business model</a> that <a href="/articles/2007/08/07/yale-university-libraries-cancel-biomed-central-membership-in-the-face-of-spiraling-costs">actually  works</a>.</p>
<p>And Sigma-Aldrich would have a far more effective marketing tool than anything else they currently use. With the possible exception of the <a href="http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/cgi-bin/hsrun/Suite7/Suite/Suite.hjx;start=Suite.HsEgrailForm.run?FormName=AldrichHandbook0708_87244">Handbook</a>, but even that could change.</p>
