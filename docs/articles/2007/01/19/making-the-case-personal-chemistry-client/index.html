      <p>Good software designed with chemists in mind is still quite rare, and when that software is Open Source it's even rarer still. Two very popular titles are <a href="http://jmol.sourceforge.net/">Jmol</a> and <a href="http://pymol.sourceforge.net/">PyMol</a>. A third, <a href="http://www.bioclipse.net/">Bioclipse</a>, is gaining in popularity. So it was with great interest that I came upon a company called <a href="http://www.akosgmbh.de/">AKos Consulting &amp; Solutions</a>, and their Open Source application <a href="http://www.akosgmbh.de/pcc/">Personal Chemistry Client</a> (PCC).</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/20070119/screenshot.png" alt="Personal Chemistry Client" title="Personal Chemistry Client"></p>
<p>PCC, as best as I can tell, is designed to be a personal chemical database. The good news is that PCC is licensed under the <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/gpl-license.php">GNU General Public License</a>. The bad news is that PCC also requires two important things from your computer:</p>
<ul>
<li>A system capable of running the Microsoft .NET 2.0 Framework. The framework itself is included with the download. Unfortunately, this requirement rules out running PCC on Linux or Mac OSX.</li>
<li>The free (<a href="http://depth-first.com/articles/2006/09/27/hacking-pubchem-free-speech-or-free-beer">as in beer</a>) ActiveX plugin <a href="http://www.hyleos.net/?s=applications&amp;p=ChemView">ChemViewX</a> from <a href="http://www.hyleos.net/">Hyleos</a>. This plugin is also included with the download.</li>
</ul>
<p>I was able to download, install, and use PCC on my system (Windows XP Home) without a problem. Aside from some confusing behaviors of its template components, the application seems to work as described.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, PCC uses the <a href="http://cdk.sf.net">Chemistry Development Kit</a> (CDK) for structure searching. It's not clear what rendering engine is used by the ChemViewX plugin. Just looking at the output, though, it may well also be CDK.</p>
<p>The emergence of PCC, an Open Source program developed by a for-profit vendor, is an exciting development. Business models may take some time to solidify, but chemistry clearly offers numerous <a href="http://depth-first.com/articles/2006/09/03/peculiarities-of-chemical-information">peculiarities</a> to take advantage of. And the folks behind PCC are well ahead of the curve.</p>
