  <p>Also, I've come to see that there is one big thing that ruins these fields of amateur research. That thing is SECRECY. Every time amateurs [and plenty of professionals] think they've stumbled across something important, they go silent and treat their discovery as a Big Important Secret which must be preserved at all costs from the many enemies who want to steal it. This is garbage! It is a trap which leads to paranoid megalomania. At the same time, it wrecks their discovery by burying it. â€¦</p>

<p>What are the most reliable ways to fail in science? Of course, no scientist sets out to fail, but an understanding of that path can lead to a better understanding of the path to success.</p>
<p>By way of <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/">Seth Godin's Blog</a>, I came across some interesting <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2005/01/rules_for_failu.html">rules for failure</a>. Seth's article cites the above quoted essay. Its author is a self-styled "amateur researcher." I don't necessarily subscribe to everything written, but his essay contains more than a few grains of truth.</p>
<p>So, if you're looking for good ways to fail in science, here are some starting points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don't tell anyone about your idea - they might steal it.</li>
<li>When you do tell (shame on you!), don't listen to negative feedback - nobody knows your idea like you.</li>
<li>Focus on selling your idea to the government or a big company - this is your ticket to fame and fortune!</li>
<li>Assume other scientists will be blown away by your discovery - the ones that don't get it are incompetent.</li>
<li>Don't bother to build a working prototype - it's a waste of time. If, for some reason, you do build one, keep it under lock and key (see rule 1).</li>
<li>Notebooks and record keeping are busywork - focus on real work instead. Like coming up with more ideas.</li>
</ul>
<p>Scientists showing these symptoms probably suffer from the mistaken belief that ideas are more important than hard work. Thomas Edison's remark about success being 99% execution and 1% idea couldn't be more true today. Ideas are cheap. People with the determination, ability, and humility to make their ideas work are the precious commodity.</p>
