      <p>If you've ever worked with the PubChem dataset, you may have found yourself wanting to create a custom subset that filters out certain records. This article, the fourth in a <a href="http://depth-first.com/articles/2010/01/20/pubcouch-a-couchdb-interface-to-pubchem">continuing series</a>, shows a very simple way to create a custom PubChem dataset using <a href="http://github.com/metamolecular/pubcouch">PubCouch</a>.</p>
<h2 id="theproblem">The Problem</h2>
<p>I really like PubChem. It's the world's largest collection of freely-downloadable chemical structures and an excellent use of taxpayer dollars.</p>
<p>But PubChem has faced some tough tradeoffs over the years., one of the foremost being how inclusive it should be. In other words, when to say 'no' to a substance depositor. I won't rehash the details here, but suffice it to say that the technologies on which PubChem is based are limited in important ways (for example: <a href="http://depth-first.com/articles/2006/12/12/the-problem-with-ferrocene">organometallics</a>).</p>
<p>As part of ongoing work to expand <a href="http://chempedia.com">Chempedia</a>, the free chemical substance registry, I became interested in the possibility of building a subset of the PubChem Compound registry that only contained structures that could be safely encoded by the MDL Molfile specification. Call it "PubChem: The Good Parts."</p>
<p>This database was likely to be huge and pretty non-relational. It looked like a perfect job for PubCouch.</p>
<h2 id="asolution">A Solution</h2>
<p>The software to solve this problem has been built into PubCouch. There are a couple of ways to run it, but I find one of the simplest is to use JRuby:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs bash language-bash">git <span class="hljs-built_in">clone</span> git@github.com:metamolecular/pubcouch.git
<span class="hljs-built_in">cd</span> pubcouch
ant jar
jruby -S rake compounds:snapshot
</code></pre>
<p>To get that last part working, you'll need to <a href="http://jruby.org/getting-started">install JRuby</a>. This is optional; you could also create an Ant task or use some other script. The point is that we're running a pre-packaged PubCouch task called "Compounds".</p>
<p>There's one more thing - you'll obviously need CouchDB installed, and you'll need an empty database called "compounds". The database name can be changed to fit your preferences.</p>
<p>Finally, the way this works is likely to change in the future. To be sure you'll be able to access the code describe here, please use <a href="http://github.com/metamolecular/pubcouch/commit/8208a82f42815c15b8a5207db91725bb97e01242">this commit</a>.</p>
<h2 id="filtering">Filtering</h2>
<p>After running the snapshot task, you'll see some output indicating Compound IDs being checked and written.</p>
<p>Not every compound is being written. Only those passing a specific set of requirements will end up in CouchDB:</p>
<ol>
<li>No bond annotations other than 'aromatic'.</li>
<li>No multicomponent (disconnected) Compounds.</li>
<li>No undefined stereochemistry.</li>
<li>No charged species.</li>
</ol>
<p>These happen to be my requirements - yours will probably differ somewhat. To change the applied filter, simply change the method Compounds.StrictFilter.pass. It's that simple.</p>
<h2 id="finetuning">Fine-Tuning</h2>
<p>This is all pretty rough at this point. There are many opportunities to refine the code for flexibility and performance. For example, I initially experimented with CouchDB's <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/HTTP_Bulk_Document_API">bulk update</a> capability, which compresses multiple writes into a single HTTP request. But this actually resulted in more memory/processor usage. My guess is that this was probably less due to CouchDB than it was to the JSON overhead in the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jcouchdb/">JCouchDB</a> library I'm using to talk to CouchDB. Your results may vary.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>PubChem is an excellent free resource for raw chemical structures, if filtered correctly. This article showed how to create your own personal subset of PubChem using PubCouch.</p>
