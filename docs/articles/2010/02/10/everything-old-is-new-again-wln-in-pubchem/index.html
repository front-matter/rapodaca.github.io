      <p>An <a href="/articles/2007/07/20/everything-old-is-new-again-wiswesser-line-notation-wln">older article I did on Wiswesser Line Notation (WLN)</a> seems to have interested a few people over the years. For the unfamiliar, WLN was a <a href="/articles/2007/03/14/eleven-qualities-of-the-perfect-line-notation-for-the-web">line notation system</a> that at one point was <em>the</em> way to name organic compounds. Among its most remarkable attributes was how easy it was to learn - supporters claimed that high school graduates with minimal chemistry knowledge could be taught WLN in a matter of days. WLN was used both as a unique identifier (exactly the role InChI plays today), and as a display mechanism before the advent of <a href="/articles/2006/11/02/stone-knives-and-bear-skins">chemical graphics systems</a>.</p>
<p>Now it turns out that WLN is popping up in a most modern place: <a href="http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">PubChem</a>.</p>
<p>As part of a structure/synonym interconversion service <a href="http://metamolecular.com">Metamolecular</a> has started offering to its customers, we've been analyzing the mountain of synonyms contained in PubChem. One of the things we found: a number of WLNs.</p>
<p>For example, the PubChem record for <a href="http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/summary/summary.cgi?sid=76852">Fluoral hydrate</a> gives the WLNs "QYQXFFF" (connected structure) and "VHXFFF &amp;QH" (disconnected hydrate) as synonyms.</p>
<p>Many of these WLN synonyms have been deposited as part of the <a href="http://dtp.nci.nih.gov/">DTP/NCI Dataset</a>. It's not clear at this point to what extent WLNs are still being generated and deposited into PubChem. I have it on good authority that no modern implementations of a WLN encoder exists, so these PubChem WLNs may simply be relics of a bygone era. Then again, maybe not.</p>
