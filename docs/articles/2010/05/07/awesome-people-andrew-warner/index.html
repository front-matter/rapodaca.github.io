      <p>Ever since <a href="http://depth-first.com/articles/2009/11/06/warren-delano">Warren DeLano died</a>, something has been bothering me: I never told him how much I valued what he was doing. What an inspiration he was to me for his energy and vision. How gutsy I thought he was to go against conventional wisdom with actions. How I wanted to emulate his success in business.</p>
<p>There's no excuse for this. And there are others besides Warren who I'm benefiting from - many of whom I don't know.</p>
<p>So I thought I'd try to change my ways - and use the occasional blog post to highlight some of the people who are influencing how I approach life, software, science, and business.</p>
<p>Today, I'd like to thank <a href="http://mixergy.com/about/">Andrew Warner</a> for what he's doing to make entrepreneurship less mysterious. For those of you who aren't familiar with him, Andrew interviews entrepreneurs through his <a href="http://mixergy.com/">Mixergy</a> site. I've never seen an interviewer go into the level of detail that he does, nor listen so carefully and then ask intelligent follow-up questions. Each interview is packed with useful, specific information ready to be put into practice.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether you're trying to build a business or just <a href="http://depth-first.com/tags/broken">fix something that's broken</a>, the stories told on Mixergy contain valuable lessons on how to succeed (and fail) at it.</p>
<p>Some of my favorite recent interviews include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://mixergy.com/balsamiq-peldi-guilizzoni-interview/">Peldi Guilizzoni</a>, founder of <a href="http://balsamiq.com/">Balsamiq</a></li>
<li><a href="http://mixergy.com/kissmetrics-hiten-shah-interview/">Hiten Shah</a>, founder of <a href="http://kissmetrics.com/">KISSMetrics</a></li>
<li><a href="http://mixergy.com/hookit-scott-tilton-interview/">Scott Tilton</a>, founder of <a href="http://Hookit.com/">Hookit.com</a></li>
<li><a href="http://mixergy.com/stack-exchange-joel-spolsky-interview/">Joel Spolsky</a>, founder of <a href="http://www.fogcreek.com/">Fog Creek Software</a></li>
<li><a href="http://mixergy.com/sittercity-genevieve-thiers-interview/">Genevieve Thiers</a>, founder of <a href="http://Sittercity.com/">Sittercity</a></li>
</ul>
<p>So thanks, Andrew.</p>
