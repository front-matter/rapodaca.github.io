      <p>ChemWriter 2 was <a href="/articles/2010/09/02/chemwriter-2-fall-2010-acs-lightning-talk-slides-and-ideas-for-future-sessions/">recently introduced</a> as a plugin-free chemical structure editor for the Web and touch devices. So far the only people to see the new ChemWriter in action have been those I've spoken with at in-person events (seen via my iPad) and the ChemWriter developers.</p>
<p>To create ChemWriter 2, we've abandoned Java, applets, and browser plugins altogether. ChemWriter 2 is made of the same stuff that the Web itself is made of: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We're targeting ChemWriter toward the most popular browsers in use today: Firefox; Internet Explorer 7/8/9; Safari; and Chrome. Finally, we want the ChemWriter 2 user interface on touch devices to take full advantage of what these exciting new computing platforms have to offer.</p>
<p>We haven't reached all of our goals yet, but we're well on our way. How we're getting there is a story with many twists, something I plan to shed more light on as ChemWriter 2 progresses.</p>
<p>A critical part of making ChemWriter 1 successful was early feedback from prospective customers and those interested in using the Web as a platform to advance the business and science of chemistry.</p>
<p>In that spirit, I'm happy to announce that we will soon be offering an online, private preview of ChemWriter 2. <a href="http://chemwriter.com/signups/new">Leave your email address</a> to join our list and get the full details.</p>
<p>I'm looking forward to gradually unveiling more and more ChemWriter 2 functionality over the coming weeks. If you share my enthusiasm for the possibilities ChemWriter 2, HTML5, and touch devices represent, I'd like to hear from you.</p>
