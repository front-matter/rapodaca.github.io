      <p>I continue to be amazed by the number of people I've come into contact with who read <a href="/">Depth-First</a> regularly. Many express appreciation for what I'm doing followed quickly by various reasons why they themselves can't possibly do it. Not just once or twice, mind you, but almost every time.</p>
<p>This is amusing to put it mildly. Scientists with the best training the world has to offer are repeatedly telling me that an approach they've never tried before can't work!</p>
<p><a href="http://usefulchem.blogspot.com">Jean-Claude Bradley</a> notes a <a href="http://usefulchem.blogspot.com/2009/04/is-it-becoming-dangerous-to-not-blog.html">shift in the discussion</a> about blogging and scientists. A few years ago, the concern was whether or not blogging could hurt your scientific career. Today, the discussion revolves around whether or not scientific blogging is a waste of time.</p>
<p>These questions may be important right now, but for any scientist with some life left in their career, the most important question is: What will the discussion of blogging and science look like ten years from now?</p>
<p>Only time will tell. But for what it's worth, here are some random observations I've made about blogging and science (<a href="/articles/2007/08/09/ten-things-that-surprised-me-about-blogging">and some more here</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>Over half the sales <a href="http://metamolecular.com">my scientific software company</a> has made have been a direct or indirect result of writing I've published on <a href="/">Depth-First</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://linkedin.com">LinkedIn</a> and mailing lists are highly inefficient compared to maintaining a well-written, current, and focussed scientific blog. LinkedIn forums sit behind a login, which hinders <a href="/articles/2009/01/02/the-electronic-laboratory-notebook-trap">discussions like this one</a> from taking place, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=electronic+laboratory+notebook">being found</a> later, and credited to you. Mailing lists are even worse - not only do they rank low in search results, but they're hard on the eyes, tend to be of very low signal-to-noise ratio, and you automatically shut out 99% of your potential audience, who don't subscribe (or bother to read) the particular list you're posting to.</li>
<li>Two words: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=substructure+search">substructure search</a>. Scientists are increasingly relying on Google, not SciFinder, to quickly find information. Without a blog, you're at a severe disadvantage with Google. That's such an important point, I'll say it again: You know that tool called Google that many of your colleagues are using to find scientific information - <a href="/articles/2007/04/20/self-referential">it will only locate your material easily if you maintain a blog</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Recessions are a time when many scientists' thoughts turn to the subject of how they're going to find another job. It's a time when words like "networking" get discussed in solemn tones by those with a knowing air about them.</p>
<p>Think of blogging as a way to <a href="/articles/2007/09/12/the-forward-pass-has-been-legalized-will-you-use-it">radically expand</a> the reach of your professional network. Now, how can you still afford to sit on the sidelines?</p>
