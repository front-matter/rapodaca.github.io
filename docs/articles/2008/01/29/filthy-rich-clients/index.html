      <blockquote>
  <p>If you wind the clock back enough years, the world of graphical user interfaces was ruled by standardized look-and-feel specifications. This approach was taken in an effort to centralize all of the GUI coding in applications, make it easy to document the application (everyone knows what a slider does, therefore it doesn't need to be described), and work around the relatively poor graphics performance of desktop computers.</p>
  <p>But the last decade's collision between the computer industry and the consumer has led to a huge increase in the emphasis on aesthetics in user interfaces: for everything from brand awareness to increasing the comprehensibility of sophisticated systems, to eye-catching coolness to draw the customer in, to just plain "Wow!" â€¦ Aesthetics are <em>in</em>.</p>

<p>The "destandardization" of the GUI has been underway for several years. From Web applications like <a href="http://www.picnik.com/">Picnik</a> to <a href="http://youtube.com">Flash video players</a> to Apple's <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/download/">iTunes application</a>, users are getting increasingly used to the idea that not every program needs to look like Microsoft Office, and that some of them never should have in the first place.</p>

<p>Now, it's possible to infuse Java Swing applications with the look and feel of this new breed of GUI. The new book <a href="http://www.filthyrichclients.com/"><em>Filthy Rich Clients</em></a> shows how. Covering topics ranging from threading to animation to compositing, this well-written book is a goldmine for anyone wanting to break out of a GUI rut.</p>
<p>The use of reflections, animation, fading and the like in serious applications may seem frivolous. But used in the proper context, these effects can add a great deal to usability and appeal.</p>
<p>Today's frivolous use of memory and CPU cycles has a strange way of becoming next year's must-have feature.</p>
