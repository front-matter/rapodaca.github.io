      <p>From Nature News comes <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/news.2008.1312">this announcement</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Wikipedia, meet RNA. Anyone submitting to a section of the journal <a href="http://www.landesbioscience.com/journals/rnabiology">RNA Biology</a> [link added] will, in the future, be required to also submit a Wikipedia page that summarizes the work. The journal will then peer review the page before publishing it in Wikipedia.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's unclear how this new initiative will work in practice. The only thing the <em>RNA Biology</em> site has to say on the subject is to offer a link back to the <em>Nature News</em> article.</p>
<p>This is a trend to watch very closely. A journal article is dead the moment it's published, but a Wikipedia article is a living, breathing document that can adapt as information and interpretations change. Five years from now, which will be more widely-cited - the article published in <em>RNA Biology</em> or its Wikipedia counterpart?</p>
<p>Although I sympathize with their motivation, Open Access proponents are <a href="/articles/2007/07/16/go-west-young-man-does-open-access-really-matter-in-the-long-run">fighting the last war</a> and wasting a lot of valuable time and energy in the process. Modern information technology has given scientists the potential to become independent of scientific publishers altogether; economic factors are starting to give them the motivation.</p>
<p>The old model of scientific publication is showing distinct signs of old age. In this model, a small group of scientists submit an article to a journal, which after limited peer review publishes a static version of it. This model suffers from endemic inefficiencies that undermines it both from an economic and scientific perspective, no matter who pays for those inefficiencies.</p>
<p>A new model of scientific publication is now both technically feasible and much better-adapted to the needs of science. In this new model, the "article" is never "done", gets "published" at a much earlier stage, is at least partially created by automated software and services, and is both authored and reviewed by a much broader range of participants.</p>
<p>How that new model is implemented is anybody's guess. But the move by <em>RNA Biology</em> may be pointing us in the right direction.</p>
