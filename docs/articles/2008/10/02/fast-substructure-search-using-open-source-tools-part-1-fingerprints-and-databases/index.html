      <p>For anyone working in a chemistry-related job, chemical databases are ubiquitous. A printed list of IUPAC names, a spreadsheet containing <a href="/articles/2008/05/26/simple-cas-number-lookup-and-more-with-chempedia">CAS numbers</a>, and a set of hand-drawn structures on index cards are all primitive chemical databases. They aren't nearly as useful as they could be to either the creator or his/her collaborators, but they are databases nevertheless. Anyone who has spent time in industry or academics knows that these low-tech chemical databases are everywhere. And they become more of a problem as more information is moved into electronic format.</p>

<h2 id="theproblemstructuresearchishard">The Problem: Structure Search is Hard</h2>
<p>Many of the low-tech chemical databases that professional chemists routinely share and work with would become orders of magnitude more useful if they were converted into substructure-searchable databases and published to the Web. Although there has been a <a href="/articles/2007/01/24/thirty-two-free-chemistry-databases">great deal of effort toward this end</a> in the last few years, there's still much, much more that could be done.</p>
<p>One of the main problems in creating a substructure-searchable chemical database is implementing the substructure search capability itself. This one requirement has done more to stifle the free flow of chemical information than perhaps any other. Solving the problem appears very difficult on first or second glance, and it is very difficult if you don't have the right tools. Many companies offer solutions - but at a price, both in terms of money and time, that is simply out of reach.</p>
<p>What can you do if you're just getting started with modest requirements and budget?</p>
<h2 id="aboutthisseries">About This Series</h2>
<p>This article, the first in a series, will describe the creation of a chemical substructure search engine using exclusively well-maintained and robust open source tools: <a href="http://openbabel.org">Open Babel</a> for generating fingerprints and peforming atom-by-atom searches; <a href="http://mysql.com">MySQL</a> as a relational database; and <a href="http://ruby-lang.org">Ruby</a> as a scripting language.</p>
<p>Each of these three components is a commodity that can be replaced with any one of a number of open-source or proprietary substitutes, maximizing flexibility and minimizing vendor lock-in.</p>
<h2 id="otherresources">Other Resources</h2>
<p><a href="http://merian.pch.univie.ac.at/pch/nh_info.html">Norbert Haider</a> of the University of Vienna has written a very useful tutorial on <a href="http://merian.pch.univie.ac.at/~nhaider/cheminf/moldb.html">creating a structure-searchable database using free tools</a>, which is part of a <a href="/articles/2007/04/13/roll-your-own-chemical-database-with-free-components">larger series</a>. That series differs from this one in the technology stack used and the level of detail to be provided. The series of articles to appear here will spell out the low-level series of steps needed to create a working substructure search system. It's hoped that taking this perspective makes clear the steps needed to apply the approach to alternative technology platforms.</p>
<h2 id="binaryfingerprintsandrelationaldatabases">Binary Fingerprints and Relational Databases</h2>
<p>At the heart of the system we'll build is the chemical fingerprint which is a (usually) lossy binary representation of a chemical structure. Creating a binary fingerprint is like putting every chemical structure, known or unknown into just one bin out of a very large, but finite set of bins. Although the same molecule is guaranteed to always go into the same bin, more than one molecule can be placed into each bin. This is a general feature of all <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function">hashing</a> schemes.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dalkescientific.com/index.html">Andrew Dalke</a> has written <a href="http://www.dalkescientific.com/writings/diary/archive/2008/06/26/fingerprint_background.html">an excellent series of articles</a> on fingerprints and what can be done with them. Another good overview is <a href="http://www.daylight.com/dayhtml/doc/theory/theory.finger.html">available from Daylight</a>. This article will assume you know what fingerprints are and how they can be used to compare chemical structures.</p>
<p>The problem with binary fingerprints is that they are generally several hundred bits long - too long to be represented in a form that allows direct and rapid query by a relational database system. They need to be broken up - but how?</p>
<p>A widely-used approach (and the one that will be taken here) involves breaking up the fingerprint into a series of integers that are stored in the database.</p>
<p>For example, let's say we have a 1024-bit fingerprint. We could represent this as a number from 0 to 2^1024, which of course is way to big for most computers to handle today. We could, however, represent this fingerprint as a series of sixteen 64-bit integers (which are available on most systems).</p>
<p>So, the binary fingerprint:</p>

<p>We can easily store this set of 16 numbers in a relational database table. For example, if we had a MySQL database called "compounds", we could create a "fingerprints" table:</p>

Query OK, 1 row affected (0.02 sec)

mysql&gt; use compounds;

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>Although we have neither a substructure search engine nor a database, we've laid a solid foundation for those things. The next article in this series will show how to use this humble beginning to model some simple substructure queries in a way that lets MySQL do most of the heavy-lifting.</p>
